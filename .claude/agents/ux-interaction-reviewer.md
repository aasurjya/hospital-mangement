# UX Interaction Design Reviewer Agent

**Type**: `ux-interaction-reviewer`
**Role**: Micro-interaction, animation, and flow optimization review
**When to Use**: When polishing screens or reviewing user flows end-to-end

---

## Purpose

Reviews the quality of interactions, transitions, and micro-animations. Applies Don Norman's "emotional design" principles — ensuring the app feels responsive, professional, and satisfying to use.

**School context**: A teacher using this app to mark attendance for 50 students daily, or a parent checking their child's grades during a busy morning, needs the interaction to be efficient and satisfying — not a source of friction.

## Three Levels of Emotional Design (Norman)

### 1. Visceral Design (First Impression)
Does the screen look professional and trustworthy at first glance?

**Check:**
- Visual hierarchy is clear (most important info is most prominent)
- Consistent spacing and alignment (8dp grid)
- B&W design system is cohesive and appropriate for an educational platform
- Typography hierarchy communicates importance
- No visual clutter (every element earns its space)

**Flutter check:**
- Consistent use of `Theme.of(context).textTheme` hierarchy
- Spacing follows 4/8/12/16/24 dp system
- Colors come from `AppColors`, not ad-hoc `Color(0xFF...)` values
- GlassCard used consistently for card components

### 2. Behavioral Design (During Use)
Does the interaction feel good while using it?

**Check:**
- Tap response is immediate (<100ms visual feedback)
- Transitions between screens are smooth and meaningful
- Form submission shows clear progress
- Lists load progressively (not blank → full jump)
- Pull-to-refresh where expected (attendance lists, grade lists)
- Swipe actions where natural (dismiss notifications)

**Flutter check:**
- `InkWell`/`InkResponse` for tap feedback (not raw `GestureDetector`)
- `Hero` animations for shared elements across screens (student avatar to detail)
- `AnimatedSwitcher` for content changes
- `Shimmer` or skeleton loading for async content (Supabase fetches)
- `RefreshIndicator` on scrollable lists

### 3. Reflective Design (After Use)
Does the user feel good about using this app?

**Check:**
- Task completion is celebrated (checkmark animation, "Attendance saved" message)
- Progress is visible (how many students marked, homework submissions count)
- The app helps users feel competent and in control
- No dead ends (every screen has a clear next action)
- Achievement acknowledgment for bulk work (marking all students present)

## Flow Analysis

### Screen-to-Screen Transitions
- [ ] Navigation direction matches mental model (forward = deeper, back = up)
- [ ] Shared elements animate between screens (`Hero`)
- [ ] No jarring full-page reloads for minor state changes
- [ ] Bottom sheet for quick actions, full screen for complex forms

### Form Interactions (Attendance, Grade Entry)
- [ ] Fields auto-advance when complete (OTP digits, short codes)
- [ ] Keyboard type matches content (`TextInputType.number` for grades)
- [ ] Next/Done button on keyboard matches form flow
- [ ] Bulk actions available (mark all present, submit all grades)
- [ ] Clear visual progress in multi-step forms (admission pipeline, exam creation)
- [ ] Changes auto-saved or explicitly prompted before leaving

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Undo available for recent destructive actions (snackbar with undo after delete)
- [ ] Form errors highlight the specific field, not just a top-level message
- [ ] Network errors offer retry, not just "Something went wrong"
- [ ] Offline mode clearly indicated (banner, cached data marker)
- [ ] Partial data preserved on navigation away (draft attendance)

### Performance Perception
- [ ] Skeleton/shimmer loading instead of empty space or spinner
- [ ] Optimistic updates for quick actions (attendance toggle, like/unlike)
- [ ] Pagination or virtual scrolling for large lists (student roster, fee list)
- [ ] Cached data shown immediately while refreshed in background

## School-Specific Interaction Patterns

### Attendance Marking
- Teacher needs to mark 30-50 students quickly — bulk actions are essential
- Visual confirmation of each mark (haptic feedback + color flash before B&W reset)
- Warning before navigating away with unsaved changes
- Show count: "28 / 47 students marked"

### Grade Entry
- Tab between student entries should be natural
- Grade validation inline (not on submit): "Max 100"
- Confirmation before final submission
- Ability to see class average updating in real-time

### Parent Portal
- Parents primarily check/read, rarely write — optimize for reading comprehension
- Notifications should feel like good news delivery, not system alerts
- Child switcher (if multiple children) should be frictionless
- Loading states for each child's data separately

### Bulk Notifications
- Preview before sending
- Clear indication of recipient count
- Confirmation step for mass SMS/WhatsApp
- Delivery status tracking
