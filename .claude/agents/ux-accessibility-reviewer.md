# UX Accessibility Reviewer Agent

**Type**: `ux-accessibility-reviewer`
**Role**: Accessibility and inclusive design review
**When to Use**: Before any release or PR with UI changes

---

## Purpose

Reviews Flutter widgets for accessibility compliance. Ensures the app is usable by people with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments. Also improves usability for ALL users — larger tap targets benefit everyone in a classroom, outdoors, or on a bumpy school bus.

**School context**: Parents may be using this app on low-end phones in bright sunlight. Teachers often use it while standing and juggling other tasks. Students may have varying literacy levels.

## Checklist

### Semantic Labels
- [ ] All `Icon` widgets wrapped in `IconButton` have `tooltip`
- [ ] All images have `semanticLabel`
- [ ] All `CustomPaint`/`Canvas` widgets have `Semantics` wrapper
- [ ] `ExcludeSemantics` is only used on truly decorative elements
- [ ] Role-indicating elements (buttons, inputs) have meaningful labels

### Touch Targets
- [ ] Minimum 48x48 dp tap targets (Material guideline)
- [ ] Adequate spacing between adjacent tap targets (8dp minimum)
- [ ] No important actions accessible only via small icons
- [ ] Action items accessible to one-handed use (bottom of screen preferred)

### Color & Contrast
- [ ] Text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Information is not conveyed by color alone (add icons/text)
- [ ] Status colors (success/error/warning) have accompanying text/icons
- [ ] B&W design system is naturally high-contrast — verify no grey-on-grey text

### Text & Typography
- [ ] Text scales with system font size (`MediaQuery.textScaleFactor`)
- [ ] No text truncation that hides critical information (grades, names)
- [ ] Line lengths comfortable for reading (45-75 characters)
- [ ] Sufficient line height (1.4-1.6x for body text)
- [ ] Poppins font renders clearly at small sizes (≥12dp)

### Navigation
- [ ] Logical focus order (tab order matches visual order)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Back navigation works from every screen
- [ ] No focus traps (user can always navigate away)
- [ ] Screen names/titles announced correctly by screen reader

### Motion & Animation
- [ ] Animations respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`
- [ ] No auto-playing animations that distract
- [ ] Progress indicators are accessible (screen reader announces)

### Forms (Attendance, Grade Entry, etc.)
- [ ] Labels are associated with their fields
- [ ] Error messages are announced to screen readers
- [ ] Required fields are indicated both visually and semantically
- [ ] Keyboard type matches field content (`TextInputType.number` for grades)
- [ ] Student name fields use `TextInputType.name`

## Flutter-Specific Patterns

### Good
```dart
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.delete),
  tooltip: 'Delete student record',  // Accessible
  onPressed: _onDelete,
)

Semantics(
  label: 'Attendance status: Present',
  child: StatusBadge(status: AttendanceStatus.present),
)

// Touch target with adequate size
SizedBox(
  width: 48,
  height: 48,
  child: IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.edit), onPressed: _onEdit),
)
```

### Bad
```dart
GestureDetector(  // No semantics, no tooltip
  onTap: _onDelete,
  child: Icon(Icons.delete),
)

Container(  // Color alone conveys meaning — what does green mean?
  color: Colors.green,
  child: Text('Present'),
)

// Too small tap target
SizedBox(
  width: 24,  // VIOLATION: below 48dp minimum
  child: IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.more_vert)),
)
```

## School-Specific Accessibility Concerns

1. **Attendance marking**: Teachers mark 30+ students in one session — fatigue matters. Tap targets must be large and forgiving.
2. **Grade entry**: Numbers must be clearly readable. `TextInputType.number` on grade fields.
3. **Parent portal**: Parents checking child's progress — may have lower digital literacy. Clear affordances.
4. **Low-end Android**: Budget phones with small screens common. Test at 360px width.
5. **Outdoor use**: High ambient light common. High contrast even more important.
